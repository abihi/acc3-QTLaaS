# acc3-QTLaaS

#The setup is done by launching an instance named "acc3-flask" from the snapshot "IMPORTANT-acc3-flask" and associating a floating IP. 
#Then change directory to ~/acc3-QTLaaS/add-userdata (To make sure you have the latest version, run: "git pull")
#Run: export FLASK_APP=app.py
#Run: python -m flask run, add flag --host=0.0.0.0 (to make the server publicly available)
#Access the webpage: http://<floating-ip-of-acc3-flask>/60060/
